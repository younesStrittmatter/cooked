# Character Map for Game Objects in Spoiled Broth
# This file defines how text characters are converted into game objects

# The CHAR_MAP dictionary maps single characters to specific game objects and their configuration:

CHAR_MAP = {
    'W': {'class': Wall, 'kwargs': {}},           # Creates solid wall objects that block movement
    ' ': {'class': Floor, 'kwargs': {}},          # Creates walkable floor tiles
    'T': {'class': Dispenser, 'kwargs': {'item': 'tomato'}},    # Creates an item dispenser that provides tomatoes
    'P': {'class': Dispenser, 'kwargs': {'item': 'pumpkin'}},   # Creates an item dispenser that provides pumpkins
    'C': {'class': Dispenser, 'kwargs': {'item': 'cabbage'}},   # Creates an item dispenser that provides cabbages
    'X': {'class': Dispenser, 'kwargs': {'item': 'plate'}},     # Creates an item dispenser that provides plates
    'B': {'class': CuttingBoard, 'kwargs': {}},   # Creates a cutting board where ingredients can be processed
    'M': {'class': Counter, 'kwargs': {}},        # Creates a counter surface where items can be placed
    'D': {'class': Delivery, 'kwargs': {}},       # Creates a delivery point where completed orders can be submitted
}

# How It Works:
# This mapping system allows the game to read text files (like the .txt files in the maps/ directory) 
# and convert them into actual game objects. For example, if a map file contains:
#
# WWWWW
# W T W
# W B W  
# W D W
# WWWWW
#
# It would create a room with:
# - Walls around the perimeter
# - A tomato dispenser in the top center
# - A cutting board in the center
# - A delivery point in the bottom center
#
# This is a common pattern in game development for creating level designs using simple text files 
# that are easy to edit and understand.
